# Geodesy-Class---Radii-of-Curvature
Use it for mapping, navigation, or just to impress your friends with your newfound geodesy knowledge.

Meridian Radius of Curvature (M): The radius of curvature along the north-south direction (meridian). Think of it as how "curvy" the Earth is if you’re traveling toward the poles.

Prime Vertical Radius of Curvature (N): The radius of curvature along the east-west direction (prime vertical). It’s how "curvy" the Earth is if you’re traveling along the equator.

Gaussian Mean Radius of Curvature (R_g): The geometric mean of M and N. It’s like the "average" curvature at a given point.

Radius of Curvature of a Parallel of Latitude (R_p): The radius of curvature along a circle of latitude. It tells you how "curvy" the Earth is if you’re traveling along a line of constant latitude.

Radius of Curvature in Any Azimuth (R_alpha): The radius of curvature in any direction you choose (defined by the azimuth). It’s the most flexible of the bunch!
